# huawei-ring-notifications

Due to Google Media Services (GMS) no longer working on Huawei devices Ring notifications do not work.
To get around this I have developed a node application, which runs on Termux and pushes notifications when motion or a ring happens.

What you need to install:
- Termux
- Termux:API (for the push notification)
- Termux:Boot (to start the script when your app starts)
